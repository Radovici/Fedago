# Project Plan and Roadmap

## 2024 Seasonal Menus

At Fedago, we're rolling out our services in "seasonal menus" throughout the year, each designed to progressively introduce our offerings and build a robust, federated data governance platform for generative AI.

### Spring Menu: Opening Our Doors

This spring, we are excited to introduce a suite of offerings designed to give organizations a head start in controlling their generative AI interactions:

- **OEM Branded ChatGPT’ish User Experience**: We're offering a client-specific, branded interface that mirrors the intuitive and powerful capabilities of ChatGPT, ensuring a seamless user experience.
  
- **Support for All Popular Models**: Our platform integrates with all popular generative AI models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT via their API.
  
- **Local and Custom Models**: Beyond mainstream models, we support the integration of local models such as Meta's Llama 2 (using Ollama), as well as fully custom models tailored to specific organizational needs.
  
- **Full Audit of Chats via Database (Supabase) Website for Data Governance**: To reinforce data governance, all interactions are fully auditable with our Supabase-backed solution, ensuring transparency and compliance.

**Special Offer for Spring**: As we're just opening our doors, we're looking to partner with forward-thinking organizations. We're offering these services **for free** to a select group of early adopters willing to collaborate closely with us. This partnership will help us refine our offerings while providing you with cutting-edge, OEM branded technologies to control and optimize firmwide generative AI usage.

### Summer Menu: Introducing the Fedago Abstraction Layer

Building on our spring offerings, the summer menu will unveil the complete Fedago platform, including:

1. **Fedago Abstraction Layer**: A comprehensive solution that empowers organizations to manage their data and generative AI interactions efficiently through the Fedago UI.
   
2. **Cost Reduction**: Intelligent selection of the most cost-effective generative AI options for your queries, optimizing your technology spend.
   
3. **Productivity Boost**: Enhanced prompt engineering and contextual support to improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated outputs.
   
4. **Compliance and Governance Features**: Advanced tools including filters, blockers, and cyphers to prevent the leakage of sensitive information, plus timers to halt potentially risky queries—fortifying your company's data governance framework.

**Join Us**: As we continue to expand our services, we invite organizations to explore the potential of Fedago to transform their approach to generative AI. Our summer offerings are designed to provide not just a tool, but a strategic advantage in data governance, cost management, and productivity.

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress through our roadmap, and join us in shaping the future of federated data governance in the AI era.
