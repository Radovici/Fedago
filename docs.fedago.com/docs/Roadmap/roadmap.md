# Project Plan and Roadmap

## 2024 Seasonal Menus

At Fedago, we're rolling out our services in "seasonal menus" throughout the year, each designed to progressively introduce our offerings and build a robust, federated data governance platform for generative AI.

### [Spring Menu: Opening Our Doors](2024_Q2.md)

### [Summer Menu: Introducing the Fedago Abstraction Layer](2024_Q3.md)

### [Fall Menu: Additional Modules & Reporting](2024_Q4.md)

**Join Us**: As we continue to expand our services, we invite organizations to explore the potential of Fedago to transform their approach to generative AI. Our summer offerings are designed to provide not just a tool, but a strategic advantage in data governance, cost management, and productivity.

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress through our roadmap, and join us in shaping the future of data governance and team productivity in the AI era.
