# Spring Menu: Opening Our Doors

This spring, we are excited to introduce a suite of offerings designed to give organizations a head start in controlling their generative AI interactions:

- **OEM Branded ChatGPTâ€™ish User Experience**: We're offering a client-specific, branded interface that mirrors the intuitive and powerful capabilities of ChatGPT, ensuring a seamless user experience.
  
- **Support for All Popular Models**: Our platform integrates with all popular generative AI models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT via their API.
  
- **Local and Custom Models**: Beyond mainstream models, we support the integration of local models such as Meta's Llama 2 (using Ollama), as well as fine-tuned models tailored to specific organizational needs.
  
- **Full Audit of Chats via Database (Supabase) Website for Data Governance**: To reinforce data governance, all interactions are fully auditable with our Supabase-backed solution, ensuring transparency and compliance.

**Special Offer for Spring**: As we're just opening our doors, we're looking to partner with forward-thinking organizations. We're offering these services **for free** to a select group of early adopters willing to collaborate closely with us. This partnership will help us refine our offerings while providing you with cutting-edge, OEM branded technologies to control and optimize firmwide generative AI usage.
